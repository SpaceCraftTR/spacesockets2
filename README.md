# SpaceSockets 2.0
## Makes socket programming much easier for C++ developers!

Hello, developers! Here is the SpaceSockets 2.0 (a.k.a SpaceSockets2)!

### Introducing SpaceSockets 2.0!

We've fixed some connection related bugs and added new functionalities to SpaceSockets 2.0. 

You can find really great examples under "example" folder that are made by using SpaceSockets2. For example, an implementation of "ping" utility or a web server that send a skeleton webpage to our browser over "localhost".

```sh
 $ ./make.sh // To build under UNIX like or UNIX clone operating systems that runs Bash shell.
```
```sh
 $ fscrift make // To build under Scrift shell.
```

## Important warning for developers
Porting SpaceSockets2 on Windows would be amazing. We're planning to add Winsock support to run SpaceSockets2 under Windows.
