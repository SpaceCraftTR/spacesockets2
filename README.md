# SpaceSockets 2.0
## Makes socket programming much easier for C++ developers!

Hello, developers! Here is the SpaceSockets 2.0 (a.k.a SpaceSockets2)!

### Introducing SpaceSockets 2.0!

We've fixed some connection related bugs and added new functionalities to SpaceSockets 2.0. 

You can find really great examples under "example" folder that are made by using SpaceSockets2. For example, an implementation of "ping" utility or a web server that send a skeleton webpage to our browser over "localhost".

```sh
 $ ./make.sh // To build under UNIX like or UNIX clone operating systems that runs Bash shell.
```
```sh
 $ fscrift make // To build under Scrift shell.
```

## A big update for SpaceSockets2: Windows port
SpaceSockets2.hpp includes Windows code that will be used if you are using Windows. Without changing one line of your application code, your SpaceSockets2 application can run under Windows. See the examples for further information.
